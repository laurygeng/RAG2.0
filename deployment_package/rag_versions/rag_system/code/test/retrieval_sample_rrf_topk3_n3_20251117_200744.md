## Q1. What is the best approach to communicate our loved one's MCI or dementia diagnosis to the rest of the family?
- ID: AA033, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

When sharing a loved one's diagnosis of MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) or dementia with the rest of the family, it's important to do it in a considerate and understanding manner. Choose a quiet, comfortable setting where everyone can gather, then explain the situation clearly and honestly, using simple terms to describe the condition, its symptoms, the results of the diagnosis, and the expected progression. Be prepared to answer questions and provide resources for further information. Try to stay positive and emphasize that while this diagnosis is challenging, there are treatments and strategies to manage the symptoms. Remind them that they are not alone, and the integrity of the support system is crucial. Also, leave room for them to express their feelings and concerns, and offer reassur

10 Early Signs
of Alzheimer's Disease or other Dementia:
There are many different forms of Dementia, all referring to problems
with the brain. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an early change in
the brain that may eventually lead to Dementia but sometimes resolves.
MCI is not as severe as Alzheimer Disease (AD), the most common
form of Dementia or other AD-related Dementias (ADRD). People
living with MCI are more likely to develop AD or ADRD, but sometimes
the condition may improve or remain the same.

## Q2. Who should be informed about the diagnosis of my family member with dementia or MCI?
- ID: AA034, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

The person who needs to be informed about the diagnosis of your family member with dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) firstly includes the patient themselves if they can understand their situation. The immediate family members who will be overseeing the care of the patient should also be informed. This may include the spouse, children, or any other close relatives. The patient's primary healthcare physicians should be notified as they will guide the future management of the condition. It may also be useful to inform any social or legal entities involved in the patient's care, such as their lawyer, social worker or home care provider. However, it is important to remember that confidentiality rules may apply and the patient's consent is needed before discussing their medical conditi

Supporting a person with dementia who has depression, anxiety or apathy
Space for  
your notes
5 Seeing a doctor
A person with dementia should talk to a healthcare professional, 
such as their GP, if they are concerned about feeling low or 
anxious. If they’re unable to do this by themselves, a family 
member or carer can do it for them. 
A healthcare professional will talk to the person and, if possible, 
with a family member or carer. They will try to assess the person’s 
mood, behaviour, and any changes that have happened recently 
which might be related to their symptoms.
It can be difficult to diagnose depression in a person with 
dementia because some of the symptoms of depression  
and dementia can overlap, as can symptoms of apathy  
and depression.

## Q3. Is it advisable to disclose the diagnosis to others?
- ID: AA035, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

As a physician, I believe it's a very personal decision. Disclosing your diagnosis to others is completely up to you and depends on your comfort level. However, it can be beneficial in terms of emotional support and understanding from others. People close to you can provide care, encouragement, and contribute to your coping mechanisms. Nevertheless, every situation is unique. Be discreet and considerate in deciding who, when, and how much you want to share, depending on your personal relationships and the context. Keep in mind that privacy laws like HIPAA in the United States prevent medical professionals from disclosing your information without your consent.

[1] Lee & Weston, 2011), we offer the following recommendations for SLPs if they need to 
discuss a patient’s diagnosis. To be clear, SLPs should not be the first person to disclose the 
diagnosis because it is outside of their expertise and scope of practice. Furthermore, there 
may not need to be a “heavy” discussion if the patient is able to set and make progress 
towards reasonable and helpful goals. However, there are situations when it is helpful for 
the patient and clinician to have an explicit conversation about the medical condition and its 
trajectory, such as when discussing why a patient is only maintaining rather than improving 
function. During these conversations, SLPs should foster a safe, disarming, supportive, and 
compassionate environment, for example, by being calm, atten
