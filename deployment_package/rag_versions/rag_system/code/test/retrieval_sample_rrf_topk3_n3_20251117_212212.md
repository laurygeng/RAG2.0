## Q1. What is the best approach to communicate our loved one's MCI or dementia diagnosis to the rest of the family?
- ID: AA033, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

When sharing a loved one's diagnosis of MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) or dementia with the rest of the family, it's important to do it in a considerate and understanding manner. Choose a quiet, comfortable setting where everyone can gather, then explain the situation clearly and honestly, using simple terms to describe the condition, its symptoms, the results of the diagnosis, and the expected progression. Be prepared to answer questions and provide resources for further information. Try to stay positive and emphasize that while this diagnosis is challenging, there are treatments and strategies to manage the symptoms. Remind them that they are not alone, and the integrity of the support system is crucial. Also, leave room for them to express their feelings and concerns, and offer reassur

[1] Helping Family and Friends
Understand Alzheimer's Disease
Español
When you learn that someone close to you has Alzheimer's
disease, deciding when and how to tell your family and
friends may be difficult. You may be worried about how
others will react to or treat your loved one. It's okay to wait
until you feel emotionally ready to share the news or to only
tell your closest family members and friends. By knowing
what is happening, the people you trust the most can help
support you and the person with Alzheimer's. The following
suggestions can help get you started.
Sharing the diagnosis
It may be hard to share a loved one's Alzheimer's diagnosis
with others. Here are a few suggested approaches:

[2] ● A diagnosis can sometimes help to get access to support such as
practical strategies to help with memory and thinking. It can also
be an opportunity to make positive changes that could reduce the
risk of the condition progressing to dementia.
Getting treatment for mild cognitive impairment
There are currently no medicines that are licensed to treat MCI or which
reduce the chances of developing dementia.

Symptoms can sometimes improve when a health problem that's
contributing to the condition is treated effectively. This might involve a
referral to another specialist clinic, such as a sleep clinic or mental
health service. 

However, for many people it's not clear what is causing their MCI and so
the best option may be to wait and see.

[3] Once you share the diagnosis, explain what your loved one can still do and how much
he or she understands. You might offer suggestions for interacting, such as by having
people briefly reintroduce themselves and avoiding correcting your loved one if he or
she forgets something. Encourage people to engage in activities that are familiar to your
loved one.
A young child might look to your example to know how to act around a person who has
Alzheimer's. Show that it's OK to talk to your loved one and enjoy normal activities with
him or her, such as listening to music or reading stories. Older children might have a
harder time accepting the changes Alzheimer's can cause and might feel uncomfortable
spending time with a loved one who has Alzheimer's. Avoid forcing the issue. Instead,
talk honest

## Q2. Who should be informed about the diagnosis of my family member with dementia or MCI?
- ID: AA034, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

The person who needs to be informed about the diagnosis of your family member with dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) firstly includes the patient themselves if they can understand their situation. The immediate family members who will be overseeing the care of the patient should also be informed. This may include the spouse, children, or any other close relatives. The patient's primary healthcare physicians should be notified as they will guide the future management of the condition. It may also be useful to inform any social or legal entities involved in the patient's care, such as their lawyer, social worker or home care provider. However, it is important to remember that confidentiality rules may apply and the patient's consent is needed before discussing their medical conditi

[2] ● a brain scan to look for signs of dementia.
● further thinking and memory tests.
● lumbar puncture to test spinal fluid for warning signs of
Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia.
Because mild cognitive impairment affects people differently, and
has many causes, some people experience difficulties getting their
symptoms diagnosed. This means it can take longer to get the right
diagnosis.
Where can I find support with getting a
diagnosis of MCI?
If you are struggling to get a diagnosis and are worried about your
symptoms, you can speak with dementia specialist nurses on the
Admiral Nurse Helpline on 0800 888 6678 or
helpline@dementiauk.org
If you are diagnosed with MCI, your doctor can talk to you about the
next steps. As people with MCI have a higher risk of developing

[3] The journey toward a diagnosis of MCI is most often initiated by a person's subjective complaint
about memory and thinking problems or by concerns expressed by those closest to the
individual. This is an important distinction because cognitive changes that are readily apparent to
the broader outside world are more likely to signal that the person is suffering from dementia. In
addition, people who have progressed into Alzheimer's disease are often not aware of their
memory lapses.

## Q3. Is it advisable to disclose the diagnosis to others?
- ID: AA035, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

As a physician, I believe it's a very personal decision. Disclosing your diagnosis to others is completely up to you and depends on your comfort level. However, it can be beneficial in terms of emotional support and understanding from others. People close to you can provide care, encouragement, and contribute to your coping mechanisms. Nevertheless, every situation is unique. Be discreet and considerate in deciding who, when, and how much you want to share, depending on your personal relationships and the context. Keep in mind that privacy laws like HIPAA in the United States prevent medical professionals from disclosing your information without your consent.

[1] Sharing your diagnosis with others is an important step toward
integrating Alzheimer's disease into your life. You may be
hesitant to share your diagnosis with some people, given the
impact such a disclosure may have for you. Keep this mantra in
mind: Alzheimer's disease is not your fault.

Why tell others about your diagnosis
As the disease progresses, you will need the support of those
who know and understand you. Concealing or denying your
diagnosis will limit your ability to cope with the challenges
ahead. While some relationships may be tested by what you are
revealing, other relationships may be strengthened.

[2] Some individuals choose to share their diagnosis with just their
closest family and friends, while others may be comfortable
sharing their diagnosis with a broader group of people. Assess
your personal comfort level before making this decision. You
may feel more supported sharing your diagnosis with close
friends and family first before telling others.
Consider the relationships in your life and determine who
should be included in your disclosure:
● Who are the people I feel closest to?
● Who will continue to support me with this diagnosis?
● Who I am responsible for telling (spouse, partner, friends)?
How to share your diagnosis
After deciding to share your diagnosis, consider when to tell
your news. You may want to tell others about the diagnosis as
soon as you get it. Or you may want to

[3] Timely diagnosis
There has been little evaluation of the relative clinical and cost-effectiveness of different models of service
delivery.(415) This means a lack of clarity about ‘what good looks like' in terms of diagnostic services and care,
and there is only indirect evidence that diagnosis of dementia is beneficial.(416)
The rationale for early or timely diagnosis is to sustain people with dementia and their family's well-being and
health by opening the door to care and treatment. A diagnosis upholds an individual's right to know about their
illnesses.(401) One review found that up to 92% of people with a diagnosis of dementia said they wanted to
know their diagnosis, (417) and another that 91% of those diagnosed saw benefits in getting the diagnosis, and
60% wished they had known the
