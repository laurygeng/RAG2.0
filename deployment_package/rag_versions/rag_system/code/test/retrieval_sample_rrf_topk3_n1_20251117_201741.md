10 Early Signs
of Alzheimer's Disease or other Dementia:
There are many different forms of Dementia, all referring to problems
with the brain. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an early change in
the brain that may eventually lead to Dementia but sometimes resolves.
MCI is not as severe as Alzheimer Disease (AD), the most common
form of Dementia or other AD-related Dementias (ADRD). People
living with MCI are more likely to develop AD or ADRD, but sometimes
the condition may improve or remain the same.
