## Q1. What is the best approach to communicate our loved one's MCI or dementia diagnosis to the rest of the family?
- ID: AA033, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

When sharing a loved one's diagnosis of MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) or dementia with the rest of the family, it's important to do it in a considerate and understanding manner. Choose a quiet, comfortable setting where everyone can gather, then explain the situation clearly and honestly, using simple terms to describe the condition, its symptoms, the results of the diagnosis, and the expected progression. Be prepared to answer questions and provide resources for further information. Try to stay positive and emphasize that while this diagnosis is challenging, there are treatments and strategies to manage the symptoms. Remind them that they are not alone, and the integrity of the support system is crucial. Also, leave room for them to express their feelings and concerns, and offer reassur

## Q2. Who should be informed about the diagnosis of my family member with dementia or MCI?
- ID: AA034, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

The person who needs to be informed about the diagnosis of your family member with dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) firstly includes the patient themselves if they can understand their situation. The immediate family members who will be overseeing the care of the patient should also be informed. This may include the spouse, children, or any other close relatives. The patient's primary healthcare physicians should be notified as they will guide the future management of the condition. It may also be useful to inform any social or legal entities involved in the patient's care, such as their lawyer, social worker or home care provider. However, it is important to remember that confidentiality rules may apply and the patient's consent is needed before discussing their medical conditi

## Q3. Is it advisable to disclose the diagnosis to others?
- ID: AA035, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

As a physician, I believe it's a very personal decision. Disclosing your diagnosis to others is completely up to you and depends on your comfort level. However, it can be beneficial in terms of emotional support and understanding from others. People close to you can provide care, encouragement, and contribute to your coping mechanisms. Nevertheless, every situation is unique. Be discreet and considerate in deciding who, when, and how much you want to share, depending on your personal relationships and the context. Keep in mind that privacy laws like HIPAA in the United States prevent medical professionals from disclosing your information without your consent.

[3] are simply being referred for treatment of word-finding problems attributing them only 
to age or without understanding the cause. It is an unfortunate and common occurrence 
that PWD and their families are often not fully informed about the diagnosis or do not 
understand its implications (Stokes et al., 2015). It is also possible that PWD may forget 
what they have been told if it was not written down, and often it is not. This may 
be compounded by clinicians themselves being uncertain about the diagnosis, having an 
inadequate understanding about AD or dementia, avoiding unpleasant discussions, or using 
euphemisms (e.g., saying “memory challenges” and never “Alzheimer’s disease”) with the 
result that the diagnosis remains unclear (Cody et al., 2002; Connell et al., 2004). There are
