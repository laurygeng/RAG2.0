## Q1. What is the best approach to communicate our loved one's MCI or dementia diagnosis to the rest of the family?
- ID: AA033, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

When sharing a loved one's diagnosis of MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) or dementia with the rest of the family, it's important to do it in a considerate and understanding manner. Choose a quiet, comfortable setting where everyone can gather, then explain the situation clearly and honestly, using simple terms to describe the condition, its symptoms, the results of the diagnosis, and the expected progression. Be prepared to answer questions and provide resources for further information. Try to stay positive and emphasize that while this diagnosis is challenging, there are treatments and strategies to manage the symptoms. Remind them that they are not alone, and the integrity of the support system is crucial. Also, leave room for them to express their feelings and concerns, and offer reassur

[1] Early detection of apathy is important to prevent future cognitive problems in healthy individuals and maintain quality of life in older adults with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Evidence suggests that as we age, apathy doubles the risk of dementia and therefore requires adequate attention and evaluation over time by family members and caregivers. Someday soon, assessing an individual's apathy level might become a part of the clinician's range of tools to predict future health outcomes.

[2] Music can also help a person with dementia to connect with the past by evoking memories, feelings and emotions that they might otherwise find hard to express.
For example, they may find it easier to recall memories when they hear pieces of music that are significant to them – perhaps their favourite song from the past, or a lullaby they used to sing to their children.
Using music to help a person with dementia
Music can be used in a group or individually – both at home and in care settings. You could try:
listening and singing along to favourite pieces of music
listening to music played through headphones
taking part in a music or singing group or choir
playing instruments
listening to a live performance
compiling a personal playlist that they can listen to on a smart speaker, mobile phone

Denial about the disease and its effect on the person who has been diagnosed. ("I know Mom is going to get better.")

## Q2. Who should be informed about the diagnosis of my family member with dementia or MCI?
- ID: AA034, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

The person who needs to be informed about the diagnosis of your family member with dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) firstly includes the patient themselves if they can understand their situation. The immediate family members who will be overseeing the care of the patient should also be informed. This may include the spouse, children, or any other close relatives. The patient's primary healthcare physicians should be notified as they will guide the future management of the condition. It may also be useful to inform any social or legal entities involved in the patient's care, such as their lawyer, social worker or home care provider. However, it is important to remember that confidentiality rules may apply and the patient's consent is needed before discussing their medical conditi

[3] Become an educated caregiver. As the disease progresses, new caregiving skills may be necessary. The Alzheimer's Association offers programs to help you better understand and cope with the behaviors and personality changes that often accompany Alzheimer's. You may also find it helpful to talk to other care partners and caregivers about how they are coping with the challenges of the disease and uncertainty about the future.
Take care of yourself. Visit your doctor regularly. Try to eat well, exercise and get plenty of rest. Making sure that you are healthy can help you be a better caregiver.
Maintain your sense of humor. Keeping your sense of humor doesn't mean that you're making light of the situation or poking fun at it. Humor can be a valuable coping strategy. Celebrity Champion and come

## Q3. Is it advisable to disclose the diagnosis to others?
- ID: AA035, Category: Diagnosis
- Ground truth (reviewed):

As a physician, I believe it's a very personal decision. Disclosing your diagnosis to others is completely up to you and depends on your comfort level. However, it can be beneficial in terms of emotional support and understanding from others. People close to you can provide care, encouragement, and contribute to your coping mechanisms. Nevertheless, every situation is unique. Be discreet and considerate in deciding who, when, and how much you want to share, depending on your personal relationships and the context. Keep in mind that privacy laws like HIPAA in the United States prevent medical professionals from disclosing your information without your consent.

[2] Unfortunately, people who perseverate are sometimes characterized as “attention seekers.” In truth, the person has little insight or control over this.
Possible causes
Feelings of insecurity or loss
Loneliness
Separation from a loved one
Under- or over-stimulation
Inability to express a need (e.g. someone fidgeting with clothes may need to go to the bathroom)
Tips and strategies
Distract with activities the person enjoys, like a walk or snacking
Respond to the emotion behind the person's question
Give the person something to occupy their hands.
If the person is in a long-term care home, consult with staff to see if you can fit the repetitive action into household chores (e.g. dusting the same area over and over again).
Speak calmly and answer the question like the first time.

[3] Build conversation into the project. Provide encouragement, discuss what the person is creating or reminiscence.
Help the person begin the activity. If the person is painting, you may need to start the brush movement. Most other projects should only require basic instruction and assistance.
Use safe materials. Avoid toxic substances and sharp tools.
Allow plenty of time, keeping in mind that the person doesn't have to finish the project in one sitting.
Throughout our lives, we listen to, take part in, and dance to music and sound.
For people with dementia – even those who have lost their ability to communicate or are at the end of their life – music can be a powerful way to trigger positive feelings and connect with other people.
