AA169,Aggression,"As a caregiver, I've been noticing some aggressive behavior in my loved one with dementia. Could you let me know about common factors that might trigger such behaviour?","Aggressive behavior in dementia can result from a variety of factors. Common triggers include:

1. Environmental Factors: Loud noise, clutter, or a large number of people in the room can cause agitation.
2. Physical Discomfort: They could be hungry, tired, in pain, or need to use the bathroom.
3. Health Problems: Infections or illnesses can worsen dementia symptoms and trigger aggression.
4. Difficulty with Complex Tasks: Frustration from tasks like getting dressed can lead to outbursts.
5. Poor Communication: If they are unable to understand you or express their feelings, aggression can result.
6. Changes in Routine: People with dementia may become upset if their daily routine is changed.

Additionally, alcohol can interact negatively with medications commonly prescribed for MCI, potentially reducing their efficacy or causing undesirable side effects.
