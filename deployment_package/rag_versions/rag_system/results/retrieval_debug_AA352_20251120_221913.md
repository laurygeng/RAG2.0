●Realize that family and friends often sense that
something is wrong before they are told.
●Be honest with them about the Alzheimer's diagnosis.
Explain that Alzheimer's is a brain disease that can
have wide-ranging symptoms. Memory loss is a
common symptom, but it's not the only one. Changes in
behavior and communication are also common.
●Share resources to help them understand what you and
the person with Alzheimer's are experiencing.
●Give examples of ways they can help, such as visiting,
providing meals, or helping with home safety
modifications. Let them know you need breaks.
Helping family and friends feel comfortable

someone who has Alzheimer's. Share tips to help them feel

It's also a good idea to arrange a medical check-up to rule out other physical or
mental health problems, and to review any medication that may be causing false
beliefs and delusions.
Can false beliefs and delusions be prevented?
It's not always possible to prevent false beliefs and delusions in a person with
dementia, but these tips might help.
● agree on places to keep important items like keys, handbag and wallet, so you
know where to look first if they think something has disappeared
● keep spares of essentials that might get misplaced, such as glasses or keys
● make sure they have regular eye and hearing tests – difficulties with sight or
hearing can increase confusion
● encourage them to eat and drink regularly
● try to keep to a routine and limit changes to their environment
● keep photographs of them and close family/friends at different life stages
around the house, to help them recognise the time they're living in

In the middle stage, the person living with Alzheimer's can still
participate in daily activities with assistance. It's important to
find out what the person can still do or find ways to simplify
tasks. As the need for more intensive care increases,
caregivers may want to consider respite care or an adult day
center so they can have a temporary break from caregiving
while the person living with Alzheimer's continues to receive
care in a safe environment.

Late-stage Alzheimer's (severe)
In the final stage of the disease, dementia symptoms are
severe. Individuals lose the ability to respond to their
environment, to carry on a conversation and, eventually, to
control movement. They may still say words or phrases, but
communicating pain becomes difficult. As memory and
cognitive skills continue to worsen, significant personality
changes may take place and individuals need extensive care.

At this stage, individuals may:

Interventions once a diagnosis has been made.
Principles of intervention in people with dementia
The progressive nature of dementia means that people living with dementia require re-assessment and the
application of tailored approaches to address their changing care needs over time. These needs can be complex
and include physical multimorbidity, psychological, behavioural, and cognitive symptoms and possible risks
arising from these.
Individualising interventions
People with dementia are individuals, whose support and intervention needs are influenced by their own
lifecourse, family, friendship, culture and environment as well as changing cognitive, neuropsychiatric,
functional and physical symptoms, as we discussed in the last commission.(2) Despite the availability of
evidence-based practices, dementias continue to be under-detected and many individuals' and family carers'
needs are unevaluated and unmet.(3)
Published best practices for dementia care globally include managing medical problems like high BP, diabetes,
and COPD; preventing and treating infections and delirium; environmental accommodations for safety,
preventing falls and maintaining function; medication management including simplifying and reducing daily
medications, for example, reducing or stopping antihypertensives if BP is falling; treatment of symptoms
through behavioural interventions; use of supportive and social services including assistance with activities of
daily living, physical activity, meaningful activities, social engagement, healthy nutrition and hydration and
addressing family carer needs. (2, 3, 469)
Culturally appropriate or adapted interventions.
Most interventions are developed in high-income countries (HICs). Interventions should be co-designed with
local communities to ensure appropriateness for the context, culture, beliefs and practises which vary within
and between countries.(470) In LMICs, dementia is often not recognised and diagnosed and, when it is, people

```
● Require around-the-clock assistance with daily personal
care.
● Lose awareness of recent experiences as well as of their
surroundings.
● Experience changes in physical abilities, including walking,
sitting and, eventually, swallowing.
● Have difficulty communicating.
● Become vulnerable to infections, especially pneumonia.
The person living with Alzheimer's may not be able to initiate
engagement as much during the late stage, but he or she can
still benefit from interaction in ways that are appropriate, like
listening to relaxing music or receiving reassurance through
gentle touch. During this stage, caregivers may want to use
support services, such as hospice care, which focus on
providing comfort and dignity at the end of life. Hospice can be
of great benefit to people in the final stages of Alzheimer's and
other dementias and their families.

● Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can show you how to
make your home safer and teach coping behaviors. The purpose is to
prevent accidents, such as falls. The therapy also helps you manage
behavior and prepare you for when the dementia progresses.
● Changes to the environment. Reducing clutter and noise can make it
easier for someone with dementia to focus and function. You might need to
hide objects that can threaten safety, such as knives and car keys.
Monitoring systems can alert you if the person with dementia wanders.
● Simpler tasks. Breaking tasks into easier steps and focusing on success,
not failure, can be helpful. Structure and routine help reduce confusion in
people with dementia.

Lifestyle and home remedies
Dementia symptoms and behavior problems get worse over time. Caregivers and care partners
might try the following suggestions:
● Enhance communication. When talking with your loved one, maintain eye
contact. Speak slowly in simple sentences, and don't rush the response.
Present one idea or instruction at a time. Use gestures and cues, such as
pointing to objects.
● Encourage exercise. The main benefits of exercise in people with
dementia include improved strength, balance and cardiovascular health.
Exercise also might help with symptoms such as restlessness. There is
growing evidence that exercise also protects the brain from dementia,
especially when combined with a healthy diet and treatment of risk factors
for cardiovascular disease.
Some research also shows that physical activity might slow the progression
