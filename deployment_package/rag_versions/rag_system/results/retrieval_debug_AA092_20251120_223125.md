What's the risk?
What can you do to reduce the risk?
Excessive alcohol consumption
Drinking excessively (more than 12
standard drinks per week), can increase
your risk of developing dementia.
A “standard drink” means:
• 341 ml/ 12oz (one bottle) of beer (5% alcohol)
• 142ml/5 oz wine (12% alcohol)
• 43 ml/11/2 oz spirit (40% alcohol)
Drinking may interact with medications that you are taking or
with other health-related issues. Talk with your doctor about any
concerns you may have.
Low levels of cognitive engagement
Cognitive engagement is thought
to support the development of a
“cognitive reserve”. This is the idea that people
who actively use their brains throughout their
lives may be more protected against brain cell
damage caused by dementia.
Be a lifelong learner! Challenge your brain by:
• Trying something new or doing a familiar task in a new way.
• Taking up new hobbies.
• Learning a new language.
• Learning how to play a musical instrument or joining a choir.
• Playing games such as word puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, and
memory games.
Depression
People who experience depression in
mid- or later life have a higher risk of
developing dementia. However, the relationship
between depression and dementia is still unclear.
Many researchers believe that depression is a risk
factor for dementia, whereas others believe it
may be an early symptom of the disease, or both.
If you are feeling sad, tired, hopeless, lonely, or irritable on a
regular basis, you may be experiencing feelings of depression. If
you're feeling this way, make an appointment to speak with your
doctor or a mental health professional. In addition to professional
treatment, consider:
• Learning about depression.
• Maintaining an active lifestyle, such as going on daily walks.
• Writing your feelings, thoughts, and experiences in a journal.
• Talking to your friends and family about your feelings.
• Sticking to your treatment plan. If you're taking medications,
talk to your doctor if you notice any changes in mood or
behaviour.
Traumatic brain injury
People who experience severe or
repeated head injuries are at increased
risk of developing dementia.

reduced the risk of all cause dementia (HR 0.92, 0.86-0.99) compared to sustained abstinence. (212) Sustained
mild (<15 g/day) or moderate alcohol consumption, or initiating mild alcohol consumption versus sustained nondrinkers, was also associated with lower risk of all cause dementia (HR 0.79 0.77-0.8; HR 0.83, 0.79-0.88; HR
0.93, 0.9-0.96 respectively) but as above, some non-drinkers may have been former heavy drinkers. Overall,
reduction of excessive alcohol or sustained light drinking is associated with a lower dementia risk than excessive
alcohol. There is a lack of clear evidence that not drinking alcohol increases the risk of dementia. The
observational evidence of excess risk for non-drinkers may be due to people who have previously drunk large
amounts, abstained at the time when data was gathered (and been classified as non-drinkers) and then may
return to drinking.
Social isolation
We have previously discussed social isolation or lack of social contact as a risk factor for dementia.(2) Since
then, two systematic reviews found less frequent social contact was associated with higher risk of dementia. The
first, which included eight studies with a total of 15,762 participants, reported higher dementia risk (RR 1.57,
1.32-1.85) for those with less compared to more frequent social contact,(213) while the second (with one
overlapping paper) reported a smaller increased risk (RR 1.18, 1.08-1.30). (214) Duration of follow-up may
partly explain inconsistent results from these studies; seven of the eight studies in one of the reviews had less
than 4 years' follow-up making reverse causation likely. (213) However, two subsequent studies of participants
in UKB, with 9 (215) and 12(216) years mean follow-up, found that dementia risk was higher in those who were
more socially isolated at baseline.
Loneliness is linked to, but differs from, social isolation as it is about people's feelings that their social contact is
inadequate. (217) Loneliness was also associated with elevated dementia risk in three reviews comprising 3-8

There are tests to determine whether you have certain genetic changes that
may increase your risk.
● Down syndrome. By middle age, many people with Down syndrome
develop early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Risk factors you can change
You might be able to control the following risk factors for dementia.
● Diet and exercise. Research has found that people at higher risk of
dementia who followed a healthy lifestyle lowered their risk of cognitive
decline. They ate a diet that included fish, fruits, vegetables and oils. They
also exercised, had cognitive training and participated in social activities.
While no specific diet is known to reduce dementia risk, research indicates
that those who follow a Mediterranean style diet rich in produce, whole
grains, nuts and seeds have better cognitive function.
● Drinking too much alcohol. Drinking large amounts of alcohol has long
been known to cause brain changes. Several large studies and reviews
found that alcohol use disorders were linked to an increased risk of
dementia, particularly early-onset dementia.
● Cardiovascular risk factors. These include obesity, high blood pressure,
high cholesterol and the buildup of fats in the artery walls, known as
atherosclerosis. Having high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in
particular, is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. Diabetes and
smoking also are cardiovascular risk factors. Having diabetes can increase
the risk of dementia, especially if it's poorly controlled. Smoking might
increase the risk of developing dementia and blood vessel disease.
● Hearing loss or vision loss that is not treated. Having hearing loss is
associated with a higher risk of dementia. The worse the hearing loss, the
higher the risk. Research also suggests that vision loss can raise the risk of
dementia, while treating vision loss can lower the risk.
● Depression. Although not yet well understood, late-life depression might
indicate the development of dementia.
● Air pollution. Studies in animals have indicated that air pollution
particulates can speed degeneration of the nervous system. And human
studies have found that air pollution exposure — particularly from traffic
exhaust and burning wood — is associated with greater dementia risk.
● Head trauma. People who've had a severe head trauma have a greater risk
of Alzheimer's disease. Several large studies found that in people age 50

Japanese prospective study following 42,870 participants for 14.9 years, found both non-drinking and drinking
>450 g alcohol/week from midlife compared to light drinking, were associated with increased risk of dementia
(HR 1.29, 1.12-1.47, HR 1.34, 1.12-1.60 respectively).(208) An IPD meta-analysis of 24,478 older adults from 15
prospective cohort studies reported that during 151, 636 person years of follow-up, dementia risk was lower in
occasional (HR 0.78, 0.68-0.89), light-moderate (1.3–24.9 g/day; HR =0.78, 0.7-0.87), and moderate-heavy
drinkers (25–44.9 g/day; HR 0.62, 0.51-0.77) than non-drinkers but not in heavy drinkers (> 45g/day). (209) MR
also finds a causal relationship between alcohol consumption and earlier age of onset of AD, and suggests that
any relationship between not drinking and AD is due to survivor bias.(210) Observational studies usually find a
j-shaped dose-response, such that non-drinking is associated with increasing dementia risk compared to light
drinking. This is probably because many non-drinkers have previously had high alcohol consumption or other
illnesses which prevent them drinking and studies which correct for this find there is no excess mortality in the
non- drinking group. (207, 211)
Reduction of excessive alcohol consumption
A study of a nationwide South Korean cohort of 3,933,382 participants that serially assessed alcohol
consumption over 3 years, found sustained heavy drinkers (≥30grams or 3 units/day) had an increased risk of allcause dementia (HR 1.08, 1.03-1.10), and reducing drinking from heavy to moderate levels (15.0-29.9g/day)
reduced the risk of all cause dementia (HR 0.92, 0.86-0.99) compared to sustained abstinence. (212) Sustained

Risk factors for dementia
What are the risk factors for dementia?
There are several known risk factors for dementia. Some factors only
slightly increase a person's risk while others make it much more likely that
the person will develop the condition.
For most people, the biggest risk factors for dementia are ageing and
genes. A person's risk of getting dementia can also be increased by their:
n
ngender and sex
n
nethnicity
n
namount of ‘cognitive reserve' – the brain's ability to cope with disease
n
nother health conditions, if any
n
nlifestyle – for example, smoking and excessive alcohol use
n
nexposure to air pollution.
You can find information on all of these risk factors in the following
sections.
Some risk factors for dementia can't be avoided – for example ageing
and genes. However there are lots of risk factors that can be avoided, or
at least reduced – for example smoking. Around 4 in every 10 cases of
dementia may be prevented by avoiding some of these risk factors.
A person can avoid some risk factors for dementia by making healthy
life choices, such as not drinking too much alcohol. However, they may
need wider changes to happen to avoid other risk factors – for example,
effective environmental policies are needed to reduce air pollution.
For more information on reducing your risk through individual lifestyle
choices, see booklet 35, Dementia: reducing your risk.

association with dementia.(203) Further work is needed to understand mechanisms by which excess adiposity
contributes to dementia risk.
Being underweight
A systematic review of 19 prospective studies where data were pooled, also found an increased risk of dementia
in underweight individuals (BMI <18.5; HR: 1.26, 1.20-1.31).(204) An IPD meta-analysis of 1.3 million people
from 39 prospective cohort studies found that obesity was a risk factor for dementia in cohorts where baseline
was >15 years before but appeared protective if <10 before dementia. 193 Their interpretation was that increased
risk in the weight loss group was due to reverse causation, as people often lose weight before they develop
dementia. Being underweight is also potentially linked with malnutrition, although it can occur for many
reasons.
Excessive alcohol consumption
In the previous Lancet Commission, we found that drinking >21 UK units (14 US drinks, 168g) of ethanol weekly
in midlife compared with lighter drinking (<14 units) was associated with an increased risk of dementia (RR 1.18,
1.06-1.31).(2) Similarly, a subsequent individual participant meta-analysis of 131,415 participants from France,
UK, Sweden and Finland found, after adjusting for confounders, heavier drinking ( > 21 units/week) in midlife,
compared to lighter drinking, was associated with an increased risk of dementia (HR 1.22, 1.01-1.48).(205) In
line with this a review of 28 systematic reviews concluded that heavy alcohol use was associated with increased
risk of all-cause dementia and reduced grey matter volume in imaging studies. (206) Alcohol-induced loss of
consciousness increased dementia risk in those with either moderate or heavy consumption. (205)
Non-drinkers
Some cross-sectional studies of older adults have found a similar dementia risk in heavy alcohol drinkers and
non-drinkers but some people who are counted as non-drinkers were previously heavy drinkers. (207) A

● Infections and immune disorders. Dementia-like symptoms can result
from a fever or other side effects of the body's attempt to fight off an
infection. Multiple sclerosis and other conditions caused by the body's
immune system attacking nerve cells also can cause dementia.
● Metabolic or endocrine problems. People with thyroid problems and low
blood sugar can develop dementia-like symptoms or other personality
changes. This also is true for people who have too little or too much sodium
or calcium, or problems absorbing vitamin B-12.
● Low levels of certain nutrients. Not getting enough of certain vitamins or
minerals in your diet can cause dementia symptoms. This includes not
getting enough thiamin, also known as vitamin B-1, which is common in
people with alcohol use disorder. It also includes not getting enough vitamin
B-6, vitamin B-12, copper or vitamin E. Not drinking enough liquids, leading
to dehydration, also can cause dementia symptoms.
● Medicine side effects. Side effects of medicines, a reaction to a medicine
or an interaction of several medicines can cause dementia-like symptoms.
● Subdural bleeding. Bleeding between the surface of the brain and the
covering over the brain can be common in older adults after a fall. Subdural
bleeding can cause symptoms similar to those of dementia.
● Brain tumors. Rarely, dementia can result from damage caused by a brain
tumor.
● Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. This condition is a buildup of fluid in the
cavities in the brain known as ventricles. It can result in walking problems,
loss of bladder control and memory loss.
Risk factors
Many factors can eventually contribute to dementia. Some factors, such as age, can't be
changed. You can address other factors to reduce your risk.
Risk factors that can't be changed
● Age. The risk of dementia rises as you age, especially after age 65.
However, dementia isn'ta typical part of aging. Dementia also can occur in
younger people.
● Family history. Having a family history of dementia puts you at greater risk
of developing the condition. However, many people with a family history
never develop symptoms, and many people without a family history do.
