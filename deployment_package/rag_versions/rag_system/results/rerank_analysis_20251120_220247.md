What's the risk? What can you do to reduce the risk? Excessive alcohol consumption Drinking excessively (more than 12 standard drinks per week), can increase your risk of developing dementia. A “standard drink” means: • 341 ml/ 12oz (one bottle) of beer (5% alcohol) • 142ml/5 oz wine (12% alcohol) • 43 ml/11/2 oz spirit (40% alcohol) Drinking may interact with medications that you are taking or with other health-related issues. Talk with your doctor about any concerns you may have. Low levels of cognitive engagement Cognitive engagement is thought to support the development of a “cognitive reserve”. This is the idea that people who actively use their brains throughout their lives may be more protected against brain cell damage caused by dementia. Be a lifelong learner! Challenge your brain

- **Question**: What are the usual indications of apathy in a family member who has dementia?

It is important to diagnose depression in people with dementia because depression may respond to treatment. The symptoms of depression can be similar to symptoms of dementia. Therefore, it is often difficult to identify depression in people with dementia. There are some common signs of depression to be aware of: ● Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities ● Lack of energy ● Problems sleeping ● Increased confusion ● Loss of appetite and weight If you are concerned about depression, speak to the person's doctor. What is apathy? Apathy is a word that describes loss of interest, motivation and/or persistence. It means not caring and not being social with others. The person with dementia may develop this apathy (become apathetic) and feel unmotivated to do anything. Apathy can be a symp

### Line 6 — Question_ID `AA216` — max=0.1958 — num_scores=1
- **Question**: What strategies can I use to improve the appetite of a family member with dementia?
- Passage[1] source: `/Users/gengminjie/Desktop/code/RAG/deployment_package/rag_versions/rag_system/code/downloaded_files/Psychological Symptoms/Apathy/What to do/Overview.pdf`
```
● Make the person feel valued and productive. ● Be ready to help the person start an activity. ● Make the person with dementia feel included in groups. ● Have the person participate in activities that do not require active participation, such as listening to music. ● Some people with dementia may respond to a type of medication called a cholinesterase inhibitor. You may want to discuss this with a doctor. ●

- **Question**: What are some cognitive activities that could potentially benefit my family member who has MCI?
- Passage[1] source: `/Users/gengminjie/Desktop/code/RAG/deployment_package/rag_versions/rag_system/code/downloaded_files/Disease/MCI/What is it_ Symptoms_ Causes and risks_/Alzheimers.org (1).pdf`

What is mild cognitive impairment (MCI)? Mild cognitive impairment is when a person starts to have problems with their memory or thinking. These may cause difficulties, but not so much that they interfere with doing everyday tasks.  For some people MCI is an early sign of a disease that will eventually cause dementia. However, MCI is not dementia. It can be caused by other health problems, such as sleep disorders or the side effects of medicines. Some mental abilities, such as memory and concentration, can become less reliable as a person gets older. This often becomes more noticeable around age 60 and older. It can be frustrating, but it rarely stops a person from doing normal everyday activities.   However, some people feel these changes more quickly, and may become worried that somethin

- **Question**: What are the appropriate hygiene practices I should utilize for a family member with dementia who is facing incontinence issues?

who has apathy Try to find tasks and activities they will enjoy and find meaningful Have a basic daily routine to provide a reassuring structure to each day. Have a weekly routine with a few activities that suit the person's preferences and personality. This could be a group session or simply visiting the park and seeing grandchildren. Identify activities that the person has a realistic chance of actively contributing to and feeling in control. This will help to rebuild their confidence. Create a safe space where they are free to get things wrong Local dementia support groups provide a place where dementia symptoms are accepted and understood, and where no one should have to worry about embarrassing themselves or others. Try to apply these principles to home life by not getting angry or up

## Preliminary analysis — possible causes

- Reranker truncation: if passages are heavily truncated before scoring, important context may be missing.
- Poor initial retrieval: EnsembleRetriever may return low-relevance passages so reranker has nothing strongly relevant to score highly.
- Reranker model mismatch: chosen cross-encoder may be weak or not suitable for the domain; CPU fallback or fallback model may be used at runtime.
- Passage length / tokenization issues: long passages or artifacts may confuse the cross-encoder.
- Evaluation metric mismatch: cross-encoder scores may not be calibrated to [0,1] with interpretable threshold; low absolute values can be expected depending on model.

## Recommended next steps

1. Re-run reranking locally for the low rows using the same cross-encoder interactively to inspect raw scores and logits.
2. Increase `RAG_RERANK_PASSAGE_CHARS` (or disable truncation) for a test to see if scores improve.
3. Check which reranker model was actually loaded at runtime (logs show model name and device).
4. Inspect initial retrieval (BM25 and vector) for those queries to ensure candidate set contains relevant passages.
5. Optionally try an alternative cross-encoder (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2) to compare scores.
