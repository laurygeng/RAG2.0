AA085,Diet,Would a ketogenic diet be appropriate for my family member who has mild cognitive impairment?,"While some studies suggest that a ketogenic diet might improve cognitive function in cases of neurodegenerative diseases, more research is needed in this area to fully understand the potential benefits and risks. It could be considered as a lifestyle change with close medical supervision, as a ketogenic diet requires a significant reduction in carbohydrate intake and increase in fats, which might not be suitable for everyone. It can also have side effects, like constipation, vitamin deficiencies and heart problems. I recommend discussing this in detail with a professional nutritionist or a healthcare provider who is knowledgeable about your family member's health status."
